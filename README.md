![alt text](https://www.bualabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/langchain_logo.jpg "Langchain Logo" )
The Email Fixer app is designed to help you improve your email writing skills by converting your emails into a more professional format. It utilizes the power of LangChain, LangChain is a framework that revolves around large language models (LLMs). It enables the development of applications using LLMs for various purposes like chatbots, generative question-answering, summarization, and more.


The framework allows you to “chain” together different components to create advanced use cases with LLMs. These components include prompt templates, LLMs themselves (such as GPT-3 or BLOOM), agents that use LLMs to make decisions, and memory for short-term or long-term storage. With this app, you can easily convert your emails to a desired tone (formal or informal) and English dialect (American or British) with just a few clicks.

## About LangChain
This app is powered by LangChain, LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that are:

Data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data
Agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment
The main value props of LangChain are:

Components: abstractions for working with language models, along with a collection of implementations for each abstraction. Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not
Off-the-shelf chains: a structured assembly of components for accomplishing specific higher-level tasks
Off-the-shelf chains make it easy to get started. For more complex applications and nuanced use-cases, components make it easy to customize existing chains or build new ones.
